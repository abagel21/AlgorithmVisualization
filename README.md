# Algorithm Visualization
After finishing the Algorithms Part I course on coursera, I decided to complete a self-designed capstone project involving visualizing the main sorting algorithms in the course to better understand their intricacies and challenge myself while practicing algorithmic design, typescript, and a static website. After completing Honors Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures in my first semester of college, I added in graphs, trees, and strings.

## Demo
The site is hosted at <a href='https://algorithms-visualize.netlify.app'>algorithms-visualize.netlify.app</a>.

## Features
The site includes selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort, three way quicksort, heapsort, shellsort, and an obligatory Knuth shuffle as used in the two quicksort algorithms. It also includes DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, A* Search, complemented by underlying generic implementations of a Queue, Stack, Priority Queue, and Hash Table in Typescript. To improve user experience and the value of the visualization, not only can the functions be paused while running, the speed can be changed during the algorithm to better experience the nuances of the sorting. Furthermore, the user can choose between randomized, sorted, descending sorted, and randomized with many duplicates data in order to showcase advantages of certain algorithms over others.
